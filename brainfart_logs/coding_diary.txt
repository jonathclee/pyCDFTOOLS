! created an "in_out" module for saving variables etc.
  ?? probably want to turn everything into a class and imbue instead as
     "ds.out_netcdf(varname=blah, filename=blah)" or whatever

* probably want to imbue the following onto the resulting dataset objects if
  they don't exist by default
  -- co-ordinate files
  -- time
  -- description + attributes (including "standard_name" at a minimum)

* so far only going to have a few routines (probably curl, div, moc, eke) to
  test what things to pass and imbue onto the the resulting dataset object
  !? going to be writing subroutines rather than as a class with imbued
     functions, to leave flexibility for module namings
     -- otherwise will have to detect variable names, not flexible maybe
     -- but relies on the user to know what to throw in

* not sure how structure is going to work
  -- not pythonic to have one function per file (somewhat as in CDFTOOLS), so
     probably something like
     -- analysis.py   (the calculation based subroutines)
        -- not sure about this, because the file will probably be huge
     -- eos.py        (for equation of state things)
     -- preprocess.py (for bullying data into a form xnemogcm understands)
     -- plot.py       (generic plotting commands)
     -- cosmetics.py  (cosmetic things, e.g. add in a clock)
  -- so would do
  
     from pyCDFTOOLS.analysis import *
     moc = cdfmoc(whatever)
